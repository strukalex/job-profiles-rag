Deploy open-webui to openshift

This folder contains two options - base and gpu. We can ignore gpu for now as that is not an option on openshift.

To apply the kustomization files and create the objects in the namespace, run

`` oc apply -k /base ``

Under Admin Settings -> Connections, add the Ollama API connection as 

http://ollama-service.fd34fb-dev.svc.cluster.local:11434

add custom API connection under Open API connection
